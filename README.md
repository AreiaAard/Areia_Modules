Plugin modules

# Instructions
These modules are meant to help plugins function. If you are trying to install
one of my plugins and getting an error that says something about a module not
being found, chances are that plugin requires one of these files. The plugin
documentation will always mention what if any nonstandard modules it requires.

To install a module, download it and place it into your MushClient/lua folder.
That's it! Once that's done, try reinstalling the plugin. If you put the cor-
rect module(s) in the correct place, the errors should no longer occur.
